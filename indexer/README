In the Shell, enter:
indexer [TARGET DIR] [INDEX FILE 1] [INDEX FILE 2] [NEW INDEX FILE]
where the target dir, index file 1, index file 2, and new index file follow the requirements described below*

If the program is propoerly called, the files in the directory will be read and all the html code found in those files will be parsed through.  Then a new file "INDEX FILE" will be created that holds an inverted index with line formats "word numberOfFiles doc_id freq ..."

*Requirements:

- there must be files in the target dir
- index file 1 must not exist yet because we don't want to write over an existing file
- index file 2 must already exist or be the same as index file 1
- new index file must not exist yet becauase we don't want to write over an existing file
- you can only run indexer if you have the first three arguments, or all five arguments
